Excellent. Let's dive into the next critical topic: Session Hijacking. To understand how to hijack something, you first need to understand what it is you're hijacking. So, we'll start with the very concept of a session.

Topic 68: Intro to Session Hijacking

Imagine you walk into a secure bank. You don't want to show your ID and passcode for every single transaction, right? So, the bank gives you a unique visitor badge after verifying your identity once. As long as you wear that badge, the bank staff knows you are the authenticated customer. Now, what if a thief could somehow steal your visitor badge and wear it himself? The bank staff would now treat the thief as you. That, in essence, is session hijacking.

In the digital world, the web is stateless. This means that every time you click a link or load a new page, the web server treats it as a brand new, independent request. It has no built-in memory of who you are from one click to the next. This is a problem for services like online banking or email, where you need to be remembered as you navigate from your inbox to a specific email to the settings page.

To solve this, we use sessions. When you log in successfully to a website, the server creates a session for you. This session is a small file or a memory space on the server where it stores information about you, like your username, your user ID, and your privileges. But how does the server know that the next page request is coming from you, the authenticated user, and not from a stranger? This is where the session ID comes in.

The session ID is a long, complex, random string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your session. The moment you log in, the server generates this unique session ID and sends it back to your web browser. Your browser then stores this session ID, almost always in a small piece of data called a cookie. From that point on, with every single request you make to that website, your browser automatically, without you noticing, sends this session ID cookie back to the server. The server looks at the incoming session ID, matches it to its stored session, and says, "Ah, this is John Doe, show him his account page."

Session hijacking is the attack where an attacker steals your valid session ID. If the attacker can get this string of characters, they can present it to the web server from their own browser. The server, seeing a valid session ID, has no way of knowing it is not you. It will grant the attacker the same access it grants you. They can read your private data, perform actions on your behalf, and effectively become you on that website, all without ever knowing your password.

This is a devastating attack because it bypasses authentication entirely. The attacker doesn't need to crack your strong password. They just need to steal the key that proves you are already logged in.

There are several ways an attacker can steal this session ID. They can eavesdrop on your network traffic if it is not encrypted, which is called sniffing. They can trick you into clicking a malicious link that sends your cookie to them, which is cross-site scripting. They can use a malicious program on your computer to read your browser's memory, which is a local malware attack. Or, they can simply predict a weak, non-random session ID generated by the application.

The goal of session hijacking is to take over this active session, this ongoing conversation you are having with the server, and take control of it for malicious purposes. For the ethical hacker, understanding this is crucial because you need to test the applications you are assessing to see if their sessions are robust and resistant to these theft techniques.

Hands-On Assignment for Topic 68

For this, you will need your lab and a vulnerable web app like bWAPP.

1.  Log In and Find the Cookie: Go to bWAPP and log into any user account. Once logged in, open your browser's Developer Tools (usually F12). Go to the Network tab and refresh the page. Click on any request to the bWAPP server and look at the Cookies section in the request headers. You will see a cookie, likely named PHPSESSID, and its value. This is your session ID. Write this value down.

2.  Session Confirmation: Open a completely different browser, or an incognito/private browsing window. Navigate to the same bWAPP application. Do not log in. Now, use a browser extension to edit cookies (like "EditThisCookie" or manually set it in Developer Tools). Add a new cookie with the exact same name (e.g., PHPSESSID) and set its value to the session ID you copied from your first, logged-in browser. Refresh the page in this second browser. What happens? If the application is vulnerable, you will be logged in as the user from the first browser without entering any password. You have just successfully performed a manual session hijacking.

Glossary for Topic 68

Session: A series of interactions between a user and a web application that happens over a certain period. The server creates a session to remember a user after they log in.

Session ID: A unique, secret string assigned to a user by the web server after login. It is the key that proves your identity for the rest of your browsing session. It is like the visitor badge from the bank.

Cookie: A small piece of data stored on your computer by your web browser. Its main job is to remember information about you, like your site preferences or, most importantly, your session ID. It is the wallet where your visitor badge is stored.

Session Hijacking: The attack of stealing or predicting a valid session ID to impersonate a user and gain unauthorized access to the web server. It is the digital equivalent of stealing someone's visitor badge to impersonate them inside a secure building.

Stateless Protocol: A characteristic of the HTTP protocol where each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. The web server has no native memory, so sessions are needed to create state.

Authentication: The process of verifying who you are, like logging in with a username and password.
