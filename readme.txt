Of course. Here are two descriptions for your CEH notes repository, one in plain text and one formatted for a README.md file.

### Plain Text Description (for repo overview or simple text files)

Repo Name: ceh-ethical-hacking-notes

Description: A comprehensive collection of my notes and study materials for the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification. This repo is a continuous work-in-progress, documenting key concepts, methodologies, tools, and commands essential for the exam and practical penetration testing. Topics covered include the Cyber Kill Chain, the CIA Triad, penetration testing phases, vulnerability assessment, and common attack vectors. The goal is to create a structured knowledge base for myself and others on the cybersecurity learning path. Feel free to use, contribute, or suggest corrections.

# CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) Study Notes

## Overview

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base for preparing for the EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification. It contains structured notes on core cybersecurity concepts, attack methodologies, defensive techniques, and practical command-line tools.

## Contents

The notes are organized by topic and cover the fundamental domains of the CEH curriculum, including:

*   **Ethical Hacking Introduction:** Understanding the landscape and the role of an ethical hacker.
*   **Reconnaissance & Scanning:** Techniques for information gathering and vulnerability discovery.
*   **The Cyber Kill Chain & Attack Phases:** Modeling the stages of a cyber attack.
*   **The CIA Triad:** The core principles of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
*   **Penetration Testing Methodologies:** Structured approaches to security assessments (Black-box, White-box, Gray-box).
*   **Key Terminology:** Definitions for threats, vulnerabilities, risks, exploits, and countermeasures.
*   **Cyber Laws & Professional Conduct:** Understanding the legal framework governing ethical hacking.

## Goal

The primary aim is to consolidate my learning in a clear, searchable format. By making these notes public, I hope they can also serve as a helpful resource for other students and aspiring security professionals.
